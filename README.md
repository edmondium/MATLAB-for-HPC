MATLAB for HPC at Jülich Supercomputing Center (JSC) is a hybrid workshop on parallel computing using large compute resources. The workshop includes hands-on exercises where you learn how to effectively use MATLAB and MATLAB Parallel Server to speed up your computations on the cluster at the Jülich Supercomputing Center.
- This course is organized by the [NCC Germany](https://www.eurocc-access.eu/about-us/meet-the-nccs/ncc-germany/)

#### Attendees will learn the following:
- How to submit MATLAB jobs to the HPC cluster, including hands-on submission of example jobs 
- Ways to tune job submissions, including accessing GPUs on the HPC cluster
- How to optimize job submissions
- Troubleshooting job submission techniques
- Best practices for rehosting code
- Opportunity to discuss their MATLAB code in-person with experts from MathWorks

#### Target Audience
Beginner/Intermediate: Students, postdocs, and other academic users with a beginner/intermediate knowledge of MATLAB and/or using MATLAB for parallel computing on an HPC cluster.
Users from commercial backgrounds are welcome to attend, but **cannot** access the cluster hands-on. 

#### Notes
For every Participant, please log in to Zoom during the course under the full name (as you provided in your registration). This is important for checking the registration. Participants who do not provide their full name will be excluded from the course.
